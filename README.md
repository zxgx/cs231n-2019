#CS231n-2019
###My solution for the assignments of [cs231n](http://cs231n.github.io/) in 2019
I have completed the first 2 assignments, and the first 2 ipynbs which cover the implementation of RNN and LSTM in assignment 3. I do these assignments mainly for revising deep learning, and uploading a neat version of my solution.
